## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Ruibin Yuan!  

I'm an **AI researcher, developer, and musician** on a mission to teach AGI music. I believe artificial general intelligence should not only **appreciate** and **understand** music but also **compose** it.  

### ðŸš€ What I'm Working On  
- ðŸŽµ **[YuE](https://github.com/multimodal-art-projection/YuE)** â€“ an open and powerful **music generation foundation model**.  
- ðŸŽ¤ Leading **music/audio research** at the [Multimodal Art Projection (MAP) Research Community](https://huggingface.co/m-a-p). 
- ðŸŽ“ I earned my Master's at **CMU** and am currently pursuing a **PhD at HKUST**.  
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love pushing the boundaries of AI + musicâ€”so much that I sneak music-related problems into AI benchmarks, e.g. [MMMU](https://huggingface.co/datasets/MMMU/MMMU), [OmniBench](https://github.com/multimodal-art-projection/OmniBench).

### ðŸŒŸ Let's Build Together  
I'm always open to collaboration and new ideas. If you're excited about AI and music, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/Z8ZHxS44uE) and create something amazing!

Potential topics:
- A publicly available lyrics2song dataset.
- A better diffusion upsampler for YuE.
- An evaluation metric for musicality.
- Injecting more controls into YuE.
- A music arena for popular music generation systems.
