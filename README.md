## 👋 Hi, I'm Ruibin Yuan!  

I'm an **AI researcher, developer, and musician** on a mission to teach AGI music. I believe artificial general intelligence should not only **appreciate** and **understand** music but also **compose** it.  

### 🚀 What I'm Working On  
- 🎵 **[YuE](https://github.com/multimodal-art-projection/YuE)** – an open and powerful **music generation foundation model**.  
- 🎤 Leading **music/audio research** at the [Multimodal Art Projection (MAP) Research Community](https://huggingface.co/m-a-p). 
- 🎓 I earned my Master's at **CMU** and am currently pursuing a **PhD at HKUST**.  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love pushing the boundaries of AI + music—so much that I sneak music-related problems into AI benchmarks, e.g. [MMMU](https://huggingface.co/datasets/MMMU/MMMU), [OmniBench](https://github.com/multimodal-art-projection/OmniBench).

### 🌟 Let's Build Together  
I'm always open to collaboration and new ideas. If you're excited about AI and music, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/Z8ZHxS44uE) and create something amazing!

Potential topics:
- 🎤 **A publicly available Lyrics2Song dataset**.  
- 🎚️ **Better diffusion upsampling for YuE** – improving audio fidelity and resolution.  
- 🎵 **An evaluation metric for musicality**.  
- 🎛️ **Injecting more controls into YuE**.  
- ⚔️ **A music arena for popular AI music systems**.  
- 🌍 **NMLB (No Music Left Behind)** – a large-scale project to collect all human music (not just western music) and build **music understanding & generation models** on top of it.
